hello i'm matt and welcome to my github user page. 

on the side you'll see some repositories filled with elegantly written js. 
don't actually click on them and read my code, just trust that it's elegant and read no further. please.

if you did read my code, i apologize. return in 3-6 months for elegance the likes of which you have seen before.

have a great day.
